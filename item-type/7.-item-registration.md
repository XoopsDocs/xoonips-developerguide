The flow of item registration is as [shown in Figure 7.1. “Flow of creating item registration screen”](https://xoonips.osdn.jp/manuals/itemtype-340/register.html#fig.register.workflow) . Registration is done according to the following flow.

1. Enter the registration details in the registration form
2. Display the contents on the registration content confirmation form and check the contents by the system
3. Registration execution

### 1. Registration form request

The item type module creates a registration form in response to a system registration request. The registration form is output in HTML format.

Define the registration form creation process in the following function of the item type module. The system will call back this function when the registration form is needed.

* function &lt;module name&gt; GetRegisterBlock \(\)
  * Arguments: None
  * Return value: HTML of registration form

#### 1.1. Creating a registration form for Basic Information

Call the function of the common library and create the registration form of Basic Information. Since you can get the form for each field of Basic Information, extract the necessary fields from it and create the form.

See also the following items.

* xnpGetBasicInformationRegisterBlock

#### 1.2. Creating a registration form for Detail Information

The method of creating the registration form for Detail Information is not specified. As long as the output HTML does not interfere with the screen configuration and operation of the system, it does not matter how you create it. You can use the functions provided in the common library to generate registration forms for attachments and images.

When returning to the edit form from the content confirmation screen \( [Fig. 7.2.](https://xoonips.osdn.jp/manuals/itemtype-340/register.html#fig.register.view-parameter) \(3\) of ["Screen transition and transmission parameters"](https://xoonips.osdn.jp/manuals/itemtype-340/register.html#fig.register.view-parameter) \), it was given by POST to set the previously entered item information to the initial value of the form. Set the information to the default value of the form

* xnpGetAttachmentRegisterBlock
* xnpGetTextFileRegisterBlock
* xnpGetRightsRegisterBlock
* xnpGetIndexRegisterBlock
* xnpGetDownloadLimitationOptionRegisterBlock
* xnpGetDownloadNotificationOptionRegisterBlock

#### 1.3. Parameter check function

Define a check function that performs parameter check on the Web browser in the output HTML. Define the following function in JavaScript. Definition is required even if parameter check is not performed.

* function OnSubmitItemType \(form\)
  * Arguments: form \(object of registration form\)
  * Return value: true \(no abnormality\), false \(with abnormality\)

When the Submit button on the form is pressed, the OnSubmitItemType function is called back. If a parameter check is required for an item unique to the item type, the check process is performed in this function. Display the error dialog in this function. Finally, return true if the parameter is normal and false if it is abnormal. Define a process that always returns true when parameter checking is not performed.

If false is returned, the registration details confirmation screen will not be displayed.

#### 1.4. Reserved parameter name

The name of the parameter \(name attribute of &lt;input&gt; tag\) used by the system in the registration form \(sent by POST from the registration form\) is as follows. Make sure that the parameters used by the item type module do not overlap with the names below. To avoid duplication, it is recommended to give the module name as a prefix to the parameter name of Detail Information.

* mode
* fileID
* title
* keywords keywords
* description
* doi
* publicationDateYear
* publicationDateMonth
* publicationDateDay
* publicationDate
* lang
* related\_to
* scrollX
* scrollY
* item\_type\_id

### 2. Registration details confirmation form request

Generate a form to confirm the registered contents. Output in HTML. The system does the following for the item type:

* Parameter check function callback
* Request for registration details confirmation form

Define the registration content confirmation form creation process in the following function of the item type module. The system will call back this function when the registration confirmation form is required. This function is also used on the edit content confirmation screen.

* function &lt;module name&gt; GetConfirmBlock \($ item\_id\)
  * Argument: $ item\_id \(ID of the item you want to check. However, it is not specified when checking the registered contents\)
  * Return value: HTML of the content confirmation screen

#### 2.1. Parameter check function callback

The item type defines a PHP function to check the registered contents. The outline of the function is as follows.

* Format: &lt;module name&gt; CheckRegisterParameters \(& $ msg\)
* Arguments: $ msg \(substitute error or warning messages for checked parameters\)
* Return value: true \(no abnormality\), false \(with abnormality\)

The parameter of Detail Information is checked in this function. If there is something wrong with the parameter, set the $ msg argument to a message indicating its contents, return false, and terminate the function. If there is no abnormality, true is returned. If false is returned, the system prohibits the execution of registration processing. The contents of $ msg will be output to the registration details confirmation screen.

#### 2.2. Creating a registration confirmation form for Basic Information

Call the function of the common library and create the registration content confirmation form of Basic Information. Since the form for each field of Basic Information is obtained, the necessary fields are extracted from them and combined to create a form.

See also the following items.

* xnpGetBasicInformationConfirmBlock

#### 2.3. Creating a registration confirmation form for Detail Information

If the following conditions are met, the method for creating the registration details confirmation form for Detail Information is not specified.

* Add &lt;input&gt; tag to send each field value of Detail Information to the next page and the previous page.
* Do not use reserved parameter names for parameters to send
* The output HTML does not interfere with the screen configuration and operation of the system

You can use the functions provided in the common library to generate a registration confirmation form for attachments and images.

* xnpGetBasicInformationConfirmBlock
* xnpGetPreviewConfirmBlock
* xnpGetAttachmentConfirmBlock

* xnpGetAttachmentMimetypeConfirmBlock
* xnpGetAttachmentFiletypeConfirmBlock

#### 2.4. Reserved parameter name

The names of the parameters used by the system \(sent by POST\) \(name attribute of &lt;input&gt; tag\) are as follows. Make sure that the parameters used by the item type module do not overlap with the names below. To avoid duplication, it is recommended to give the module name as a prefix to the parameter name of Detail Information.

* title
* keywords keywords
* description
* doi
* publicationDateYear
* publicationDateMonth
* publicationDateDay
* publicationDate
* lang
* related\_to
* item\_type\_id

### 3. Item registration request

The item registration process is executed in response to the request from the system. Define the registration process in the following function of the item type module. The system will call back this function when registration processing is required. The information entered in the registration form is obtained from the $ \_POST array. Substitute the item ID of the registered item in the argument $ item\_id.

* function &lt;module name&gt; InsertItem \(& $ item\_id\)
* Arguments: Variable reference that receives the item ID
* Return value: true \(registration successful\), false \(registration failed\)

#### 3.1. Registration of Basic Information

The Basic Information registration function is provided in the common library. Call that function. This function returns the item ID. This item ID is required to associate Basic Information with Detail Information, index keywords, etc.

See also the following items.

* xnpInsertBasicInformation

#### 3.2. Registration of Detail Information

Defines the process to register Detail Information in DB. Record the Detail Information by associating it with the item ID obtained when you registered the Basic Information. This ID will be used later to refer to or edit the item information. Please note that if the association is lost, Detail Information cannot be retrieved.

A common library can be used to register attachments, image files, and texts.

The registration method of Detail Information, the use of DB, the type of DB, and the processing method are not specified, so please define them freely. If there is an association with the ID, you can manage it as a file \(CSV, etc.\) without using the DB.
