# 14. Meta information

In response to the user's request to download the attached file, the system outputs the information \(meta information\) of the item to which the attached file belongs and the ZIP archive file containing the attached file.

The system then requests meta information from the item type module.

Define the meta information creation process in the following function of the item type module.

* function &lt;module name&gt; GetMetaInformation \($ item\_id\)
  * Arguments: Item ID
  * Return value: An associative array of meta information \(including both Basic Information and Detail Information\)
    * The structure of the associative array is as follows.

      > ```text
      > array (key1 => value1, key2 => value2, ...)
      > ```

    * This information is attached to the ZIP archive file in the following format.

      > ```text
      > key1: value1
      > key2: value2
      > ...
      > ```

## 1. BasicInformation meta information

Since the function to get Basic Information for meta information generation is defined in the common library, use it.

See also the following items.

* xnpGetBasicInformationArray

## 2. Detail Information meta information

The item type module can freely define the meta information of Detail Information.
