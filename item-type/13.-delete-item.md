# 13. Delete item

Define the deletion process in the following function of the item type module. The system calls back this function when deleting an item.

* function &lt;module name&gt; DeleteItem \($ item\_id\)
  * Arguments: Item ID
  * Return value: true \(success\), false \(failure\)

### 1. Delete Basic Information

Since the delete function is defined in the common library, call it.

### 2. Delete Detail Information

The item type defines the deletion process independently. Images, attachments, texts, and indexes registered using the common library function do not need to be explicitly deleted \(they are deleted at the same time as Basic Information is deleted\).
