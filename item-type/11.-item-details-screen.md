Define the detailed screen creation process in the following function of the item type module. The system will call back this function when it needs a detail screen.

* function &lt;module name&gt; GetDetailBlock \($ item\_id\)
  * Arguments: Item ID
  * Return value: HTML of detail screen

If the user has permission to edit the item, please include the following form in the HTML of the detail screen.

> ```text
> <form id ='xoonips_edit_form'>
>   <input type ='hidden' ...> 
> </ form>
> ```

This form will be sent to the confirmation screen when you press the "Register to Public Index" button on the details screen. It is necessary to insert an appropriate input tag so that the same data that the item registration screen / edit screen sends will be sent.

If you use the function xnpGetAttachmentDetailBlock to generate the detail screen, pass the argument download\_file\_id to xnpGetDownloadConfirmationBlock and include the result in the HTML.
