# 3. Item type module overview

The item type module is an XOOPS module that receives operations such as item registration, editing, and deletion on XooNIps , creates screens corresponding to the operations, and operates the DB . Therefore, to add an item type, you need permission to install the module in XOOPS .

## 1. Callback function

When a different screen or DB operation is required for each item type, such as registering or editing an item, the system calls back the item type function and requests the screen or DB operation. Since the name and arguments of the function to be called back are predetermined, the item type creator defines the function accordingly.

## 2. Create screen

The item type module generates HTML for displaying screens such as item registration, editing, and display. The created screen will be inserted in the central column of XOOPS.

## 3. Data manipulation

Data manipulation functions for item registration, update, deletion, and search are implemented in the item type module. However, since the operation of Basic Information is prepared in advance in the common library, the function is called from the item type module. There are no rules regarding the operation of Detail Information other than the association of item IDs. There is no problem in managing Detail Information in any way as long as it does not affect other item types or systems.
