## 1. Edit form request

The item type module receives an edit request and creates an edit form. The edit form is output in HTML format.

Define the edit form creation process in the following function of the item type module. The system will call back this function when it needs an edit form.

* function &lt;module name&gt; GetEditBlock \(\)
  * Arguments: None
  * Return value: HTML of edit form

### 1.1. Creating an edit form for Basic Information

Call the function of the common library and create the edit form of Basic Information. Since you can get the form for each field of Basic Information, extract the necessary fields from it and create the form.

See also the following items.

* xnpGetBasicInformationEditBlock

### 1.2. Creating an edit form for Detail Information

It does not specify how to create an edit form for Detail Information. As long as the output HTML does not interfere with the screen configuration and operation of the system, it does not matter how you create it. You can use the functions provided in the common library to generate attachments and image editing forms.

Since the item ID to be edited \(\(1\) in [Figure 8.2. “Screen transition and transmission parameters”](https://xoonips.osdn.jp/manuals/itemtype-340/edit.html#fig.edit.view-parameter) \) is specified by the system, the value recorded in the DB is acquired using that ID and set as the initial value of the edit form. To do. When returning to the edit form from the content confirmation screen \( [Fig. 8.2.](https://xoonips.osdn.jp/manuals/itemtype-340/edit.html#fig.edit.view-parameter) \(3\) of ["Screen transition and transmission parameters"](https://xoonips.osdn.jp/manuals/itemtype-340/edit.html#fig.edit.view-parameter) \), give priority to the information given by POST and set it to the initial value of the form. POST is not performed. Obtain the information from the DB using the item ID and set it.

* xnpGetTextFileEditBlock
* xnpGetRightsFileEditBlock
* xnpGetIndexEditBlock
* xnpGetDownloadLimitationOptionEditBlock
* xnpGetDownloadNotificationOptionEditBlock

### 1.3. Parameter check function

Define a check function that performs parameter check on the Web browser in the output HTML. Define the following function in JavaScript. Definition is required even if parameter check is not performed.

* OnSubmitItemType \(form\)
* Arguments: form \(object of edit form\)
* Return value: true \(no abnormality\), false \(with abnormality\)

When the Submit button on the form is pressed, the OnSubmitItemType function is called back. If a parameter check is required for an item unique to the item type, the check process is performed in this function. Display the error dialog in this function. Finally, return true if the parameter is normal and false if it is abnormal. Define a process that always returns true when parameter checking is not performed.

If false is returned, the edit content confirmation screen will not be displayed.

### 1.4. Reserved parameter name

The names of the parameters \(the name attribute of the &lt;input&gt; tag\) that the system uses in the edit form \(sent by POST from the edit form\) are: Make sure that the parameters used by the item type module do not overlap with the names below. To avoid duplication, it is recommended to give the module name as a prefix to the parameter name of Detail Information.

* mode
* fileID
* title
* keywords keywords
* description
* doi
* change\_log
* publicationDateYear
* publicationDateMonth
* publicationDateDay
* publicationDate
* item\_id
* lang
* related\_to
* scrollX
* scrollY
* xoonipsCheckedXID
* jump\_to\_var \[\]

## 2. Edit content confirmation form request

Generate a form to confirm the edited contents. Output in HTML. The system does the following for the item type:

* Parameter check function callback
* Change field check function callback
* Request for edit confirmation form

Define the edit content confirmation form creation process in the following function of the item type module. The system calls back this function when it needs an edit confirmation form. This function is the same as the one used on the registration confirmation screen.

* function &lt;module name&gt; GetConfirmBlock \($ item\_id\)
  * Arguments: $ item\_id \(ID of the item you want to check\)
  * Return value: HTML of the content confirmation screen

### 2.1. Parameter check function callback

The item type defines a PHP function to check the edited contents. The outline of the function is as follows.

* Format: &lt;module name&gt; CheckEditParameters \(& $ msg\)
* Arguments: $ msg \(substitute error or warning messages for checked parameters\)
* Return value: true \(no abnormality\), false \(with abnormality\)

The parameter of Detail Information is checked in this function. If there is something wrong with the parameter, set the $ msg argument to a message indicating its contents, return false, and terminate the function. If there is no abnormality, true is returned. If false is returned, the system prohibits the execution of update processing. The contents of $ msg are output to the edit content confirmation screen.

### 2.2. Change field check function callback

ChangeLog is automatically generated only when the ChangeLog field is blank. The item type module must return the modified Detail Information field name at the request of XooNIps.

* Format: &lt;module name&gt; GetModifiedFields \($ item\_id\)
* Arguments: $ item\_id \(ID of the item to be compared\)
* Return value: Array of field names

Check the difference between the Detail Information recorded in the DB and the Detail Information value given by $ \_POST, and use the array of display names of the fields where the difference is found as the return value.

### 2.3. Creating a confirmation form for editing Basic Information

Call the function of the common library and create the edit content confirmation form of Basic Information. Since the form for each field of Basic Information is obtained, the necessary fields are extracted from them and combined to create a form.

See also the following items.

* xnpGetBasicInformationConfirmBlock

### 2.4. Creating a confirmation form for editing Detail Information

If the following conditions are met, the method for creating the edit content confirmation form for Detail Information is not specified.

* Add &lt;input type ='hidden'&gt; tag to send each field value of Detail Information to the next page
* Do not use reserved parameter names for parameters to send
* The output HTML does not interfere with the screen configuration and operation of the system

You can use the functions provided in the common library to generate an edit confirmation form for attachments and images.

### 2.5. Reserved parameter name

The names of the parameters used by the system \(sent by POST\) \(name attribute of &lt;input&gt; tag\) are as follows.

## 3. Item update request

The item update process is executed in response to the request from the system. Define the update process in the following function of the item type module. The system will call back this function when it needs to be updated. The information entered in the edit form is obtained from the $ \_POST array.

* function &lt;module name&gt; UpdateItem \(\)
  * Arguments: None
  * Return value: true \(success\), false \(failure\)
