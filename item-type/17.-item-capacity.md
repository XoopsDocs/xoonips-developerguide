# 17. Item capacity

The system limits the number of items a user can create, the number of indexes, and the total size of the item's attachments. To calculate these user-created quantities and capacities, the system requires the size of the item's attachment for each item type.

Define this process in the following function of the item type module. The system calls back this function.

* function &lt;module name&gt; GetDetailInformationTotalSize \($ iids\)

  * Arguments: $ iids \(array of item IDs\)
  * Return value: Total attachments for items specified by $ iids

  The item ID is given to $ iids. Find the size of the file attached to the item ID in the item type module and return the total. The unit is Byte.

* xnpGetTotalFileSize
